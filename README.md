# Online-Election-Management-System
DBMS mini project
The College Election Management software is designed to provide an easy way to vote online in an efficient manner. This software maintains individual candidate and voter accounts for each election. The voter can cast his/her vote online to their desired candidate by registering themselves online. Once a person casts his/her vote with proper authentication, revoting is prohibited. After the voting procedure is done, votes are counted online and the results will be uploaded. This method of web voting can provide security and no proxy voting can be done hence maintaining the integrity of the poll results.
